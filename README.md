- 👋 Hi, I’m @HeReisM3
- 👀 I’m mainly interested in game development using Unity 3D, but I'm also fascinated by everything to do with programming and creating applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to program in C# and to use Unity editor to make simple 2D games. I started my studies at Taitotalo in November 2021.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all things that have to do with programming and game/app development.
